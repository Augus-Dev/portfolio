This professional portfolio showcases projects I developed both independently and as part of online courses.  
It is organized into the following folders:

- **Projects** – Ideas and projects I have created to demonstrate my skills.
- **About** – Section dedicated to present myself.
- **Contact** – How you can reach me.
  
To add in the future: Accessibility and noturne mode.
