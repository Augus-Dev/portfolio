# Portfolio

This professional portfolio showcases projects I developed both independently and as part of online courses.  
It is organized into the following folders:

- **Self-authored** – Ideas and projects I have created to demonstrate my skills.
- **The Odin Project** – Projects completed as part of The Odin Project curriculum.
- **FreeCodeCamp's Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum** – Projects completed as part of FreeCodeCamp's full stack program.
- **CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript** – Projects completed during CS50's web programming course.

Each folder contains the project source code, and in some cases instructions to run the projects locally.
