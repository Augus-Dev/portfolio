# Odin Recipes

This folder contains the first project completed as part of **The Odin Project** Foundations course.  
It demonstrates fundamental HTML skills by building a basic recipe website.

## Project Overview

The project involves creating a website with:

- A main index page listing links to several recipes.
- Individual recipe pages, each with:
  - A title
  - An image of the dish
  - A description of the recipe
  - A list of ingredients
  - Step-by-step preparation instructions

This project focuses on practicing HTML structure and linking between pages.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The homepage listing all recipes.  
- `recipes/`: Directory containing individual recipe pages.  
- `images/`: Folder storing images of each recipe.
